# Exception
- IOException
- Checked exception represents an anticipated error or known error.
- **LBYL vs EAFP**:- 
- **Path vs File**:- File (java.io.File) represents a file or directory on the file system. It provides methods for manipulating files and directories, such as creating, deleting, and checking existence. Path (java.nio.file.Path) represents a sequence of directories and/or a file name. It provides methods for manipulating paths, such as resolving, relativizing, and normalizing.
- NIO2 (Non-blocking I/O version 2) is a Java API for performing file operations. It provides a more efficient and scalable way of handling file I/O compared to the traditional Java I/O API. In Java 7 and later, Path is the recommended way to work with files and directories, as it provides more flexibility and power than the older File class. Path is also the foundation for the NIO2 API.
## Glob
- Glob is a pattern matching algorithm that is used to match files or directories based on a pattern.
