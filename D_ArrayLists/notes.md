## Autoboxing
- Java automatically boxes a primitive type for you.
- i.e ``Integer boxedInt = 15;`` or `Integer boxedInt = Integer.ValueOf(15)` Java does the boxing, in other words, an instance of Integer and value set to 15 is created.
## Unboxing
i.e `int unboxedInt = boxedInt.intValue()`

# enum
- special data type that contains constants.
- Variable whose value can't be changed. array like, elements are known and referred to by a constant name, instead of index position
